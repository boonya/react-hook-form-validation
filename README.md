## Installation

```bash static
npm i -S react-hook-form-validation
```

or

```bash static
yarn add react-hook-form-validation
```

## The hook currently supports the following validators

- [`required` -- Required value](#required)
- [`min` -- Min value of number or min length of string & array](#min)
- [`max` -- Max value of number or max length of string & array](#max)
- [`email` -- Email address](#email)
- [`url` -- URL](#url)
- [`postalCodeCA` -- Postal Code in Canada](#postal-code-in-canada)
- [`sinCA` -- Social Insurance Number (SIN) in Canada](#social-insurance-number-sin-in-canada)
- [`pattern` -- RegEx pattern based](#pattern)
- [`func` -- function based](#func)

You can import enum of them:

```js static
import {VALIDATORS} from 'react-hook-form-validation';
```

### Required

This validator can be useful if you need to be sure that your input value is defined,
is not an empty string, array or object, is not a null.
_Note that_ other validators do not perform their logic if empty value passed to them. So, make sure you use `required` validator if needed.

```js static
{validator: VALIDATORS.required, fail: 'The field is required'},
```

### Min

If you need to ensure your input not less than expected. It can compare numbers or length of string or array.

```js static
{validator: VALIDATORS.min, expected: 5, fail: ({expected}) => `The value is less than ${expected}`},
```

### Max

If you need to ensure your input not more than expected. It can compare numbers or length of string or array.

```js static
{validator: VALIDATORS.max, expected: 5, fail: ({expected}) => `The value is more than ${expected}`},
```

### Email

```js static
{validator: VALIDATORS.email, fail: 'The value is not an email address'},
```

[verify test cases](https://github.com/boonya/react-hook-form-validation/blob/main/src/validators/email.test.ts)

### URL

```js static
{validator: VALIDATORS.url, fail: 'The value is not a URL'},
```

### Postal Code in Canada

The validator could be useful when you need to validate your input as a Canadian postal code

[A bit details about Postal Codes in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Canada)

```js static
{validator: VALIDATORS.postalCodeCA, fail: 'It doesn\'t seem to be a Canadian Postal Code'},
```

### Social Insurance Number (SIN) in Canada

> A social insurance number (SIN) is a number issued to every Canadian citizen in Canada. The SIN number is a unique number that helps various government programs like tax reporting, pensions plan, employment verification, etc. A Canadian software development company is building an employee payroll application for which they are looking for a SIN validator library.

So if you need validate an input SIN number, you could you this validator.

- [SIN Validator challenge at the CodeCrunch](https://www.codercrunch.com/challenge/819302488/sin-validator)

```js static
{validator: VALIDATORS.sinCA, fail: 'It doesn\'t seem to be a Canadian Social Insurance Number'},
```

### Pattern

In case you need to validate your input based on any random RegEx pattern you interested in, you can do it by `pattern` validator.

```js static
const pattern = /^((?=\S*?[A-Z])(?=\S*?[a-z])(?=\S*?[0-9]).{6,})\S$/u;

{validator: VALIDATORS.pattern, pattern, fail: 'Password must contain minimum of 6 characters, at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 number with no spaces.'},
```

### Func

In case you need to implement much more complex validation you can use `func` validator.
It allows you to implement any validation logic you need.

```js static
function isAdult(value) {
    const chosen = new Date(value);
    const threshold = new Date();
    threshold.setFullYear(threshold.getFullYear() - 18);
    return chosen < threshold;
}

{validator: VALIDATORS.func, func: isAdult, fail: 'You are under 18 years old!'},
```

It can be useful if you need to compare your value with result of asynchronous query:

```js static
function asyncFunction(value) {
    return new Promise(() => setTimeout(() => false, 1000));
}

{validator: VALIDATORS.func, func: asyncFunction, fail: 'You waited for an error message'},
```

## Example

```js static
import useValidation, {VALIDATORS} from 'react-hook-form-validation';

export default function Form(props) {
    const {validity, validateForm, resetForm} = useValidation([{
        field: 'number',
        rules: [
            {validator: VALIDATORS.required, fail: 'The field is required'},
            {validator: VALIDATORS.func, func: Number.isInteger, fail: 'Not a number'},
            {validator: VALIDATORS.min, expected: 5, fail: ({expected}) => `The value is less than ${expected}`},
            {validator: VALIDATORS.max, expected: 15, fail: ({expected}) => `The value is more than ${expected}`},
        ],
    }]);

    const onSubmit = useCallback(async (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const number = event.target.number.value;
        try {
            await validateForm({number: [number]});
        } catch (err) {
            console.error(err);
            alert('Something went wrong');
        }
    }, [validateForm]);

    return (
        <form noValidate onSubmit={onSubmit} onReset={resetForm}>
            <label htmlFor="number">Enter any number *</label>
            <input
                id="number"
                name="number"
                type="number"
                aria-describedby="helper-text"
                aria-invalid={validity.isError('number')}
                required
            />
            <p id="helper-text">{validity.getMessage('number')}</p>
            <button type="submit">Validate</button>
            <button type="reset">Reset</button>
            {validity.isDirty() && (validity.isValid() ? "The form is valid" : "The form is invalid")}
        </form>
    );
}
```
